# Tic-Tac-Toe Console Game (Java)

This project implements a human versus human Tic-Tac-Toe game played in the console with a 3x3 grid numbered 1 to 9. Player 1 uses “X” and Player 2 uses “O”.

To set up, clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tic-tac-toe.git` then run `./gradlew build` to compile and `./gradlew run` to start the game.

Players alternate turns entering the number corresponding to their move; the program validates input to reject invalid, occupied, or out-of-range entries without crashing.

The game detects wins (rows, columns, diagonals) and draws, announces results, and prompts to play again.

Unit tests written with JUnit 5 cover initial board setup, win conditions, draw detection, and input validation. Run tests via `./gradlew test`; reports are generated at `build/reports/tests/test/index.html`.

Reviewers should confirm that the game runs correctly from the console, enforces rules, handles invalid input gracefully, declares outcomes properly, and offers replay.

The code uses a single class (`TicTacToe.java`) focusing on MVP design with clear separation of concerns planned for future iterations.
